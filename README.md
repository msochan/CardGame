# Card game - War


## Game rules

Each card shows a number from 1 to 10. 
Each player receives a stack of 20 cards from the shuffled deck as their draw pile. The draw pile is kept face-down in front of the player. Each player also keeps a discard pile.

Each turn, both players draw the top card. If there are no more cards in the draw pile, shuffle the discard pile and use those cards as the new draw pile. Once a player has no cards in either their draw or discard pile, that player loses.

The players present their drawn card and compare the values. The player with the higher value card, takes both cards and adds them to their discard pile, next to the draw pile. If the cards show the same value, the winner of the next turn wins these cards as well.

1. When comparing two cards, the higher card should win.
2. When comparing two cards of the same value, the winner of the next round should win 4 cards.
